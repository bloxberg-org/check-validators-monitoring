    <p>Dear {{fullNames}}</p>
    <p>
      Our bloxberg monitoring system records any technical inactivity of all
      bloxberg nodes. It seems your bloxberg validator node at {{instituteName}}
      has been offline since
      <b>{{lastOnlineDateString}}</b>
      , {{lastOnlineTimeString}}.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is crucial for a robust and healthy blockchain network that all nodes
      are actively involved.bloxberg nodes are allowed to be inactive for a
      maximum of 3 months according to our whitepaper. If in violation of this,
      you will be technically removed from the network. But we don't want to
      lose you and your institution from our bloxberg association!

      <b>
        Please share this email with the technical counterpart in your team and
        check if there is a problem with the validator.
      </b>
      You can follow the instruction “My validator node seems to be
      disconnected, how do I connect back to the network?” in our

      <a href="https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/128505c5a25e4fe8bd01/">
        technical guidance </a
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can check once again if your node is validating blocks in our
      <a
        href="https://blockexplorer.bloxberg.org/address/{{address}}/validations"
      >
